You must have Node.JS and npm/yarn installed on your machine to run this code.

The file structure is a folder with all the client stuff, and a folder with the backend stuff, package.json, and tsconfig.json. 
Run yarn install inside of main directory with everything and inside client folder to get all the node_modules. 
Then run yarn start in both of theses places to run the backend and frontend.
